Feisty Galaxies

## Notes
* Latest work is in the mobileDev branch. The master branch is the original demo.
* There is a mix of PositionedSound and SimpleSound for audio. As surround support is not required for this version, SimpleSound can be used everywhere.
* The code is sloppy as there was a lot of iteration and experimentation that left a lot of cruft.
